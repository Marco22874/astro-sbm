A team of researchers at the University of Cambridge has identified a new protein, named Chronofin, that appears to play a crucial role in slowing down the aging process of human cells. The study, published in Nature Aging, opens up new possibilities in the prevention of degenerative diseases.

Chronofin helps regulate mitochondrial activity—the "powerhouses" of the cell—maintaining cellular functions more efficiently over time. In laboratory tests, cells with enhanced levels of this protein showed greater resistance to oxidative stress and exhibited fewer signs of aging.

"This could be a significant step forward in regenerative medicine," said Professor Elena Marconi, lead author of the study.

The next phase of research includes clinical trials and the development of therapies based on this discovery, aiming to improve health and quality of life in older age.
