# **Updates in Malignant Biliary Tract Tumors**

**Biliary diseases**, particularly **cholangiocarcinomas**, represent a clinical challenge due to their diagnostic and therapeutic complexity.
The congress offers a multidisciplinary analysis ranging from anatomical and biomolecular classification, through advanced diagnostic techniques like **radiomics** and **echoendoscopy**, to the use of **minimally invasive therapies** and **endoluminal radiotherapy**.

Furthermore, the meeting includes sessions on mini-invasive and extreme surgical approaches, integrated with the use of 3D simulations for surgical planning.
